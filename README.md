mc_rtc Energy Residual plugin
==

This project is a [mc_rtc] plugin, which estimates the residual energy to obtain torques.

This implementation is based on the methodology outlined in the paper: 

Collision Detection and Contact Point Estimation Using Virtual Joint Torque Sensing Applied to a Cobot - Dario Zurlo et al.

It has been implemented and tested on the Kinova Gen 3 collaborative robot (cobot).
